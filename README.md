Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

Series of solutions for an introductory competition proposed on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/) where I have to build "a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one's aren't". On this challenge, I had access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets hand classified.
